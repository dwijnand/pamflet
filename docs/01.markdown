Pamflet generates a linked sets of pages called "pamflets". Although
hierarchical organization of pages is supported, the primary means of
navigation is linear and authors are encouraged to write pamflets that
progress logically when read front to back.

The table of contents appears at the bottom of every page. The first
page of a pamflet should be brief so that the generated contents
listing will appear above the fold. Think of it as a title page, with
a few sentences of description.

### On the Big Screen

On devices with large screens--typically, laptop and desktop
computers--pamflet texts appear in a fixed-width center column.  The
margins are giant **clickable regions** for page flipping. The left
and right **keyboard arrows** may also be used for the same purpose.

### Going Mobile

Since Pamflets are meant to be carried around, having a good mobile
appearance and behavior is vital. When viewed on a phone, tablet, or
other small-screen device, pamflets take the full screen width.

#### Radio Silent

And because mobile devices aren't always connected, an
[HTML5 cache manifest][manifest] is generated for all pamflets. Add a
bookmark for a pamflet to your home screen so you can read it
anywhere.
