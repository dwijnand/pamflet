### Getting Social

Pamflet 0.5.0 adds optional Disqus and Twitter integration.
With a few [special properties][s] in `template.properties`,
you can add a comment section at the end of all pages,
and enable hovering bird button for easy citation:

    twitter=#pamflet

[#40][40] and [#46][46] by [@eed3si9n][@eed3si9n].

### Getting Global

For projects with multilingual documentation, Pamflet 0.5.0 adds globalization support. Just list your languages in `template.properties`:

    languages=en,ja

See [Globalization][g] for more details. [#42][42] and [#44][44] by [@eed3si9n][@eed3si9n].

### Color Schemes

Pamflet 0.5.0 ships with three color schemes that can be applied dynamically:
[`redmond`](http://pamflet.databinder.net/Color+Schemes.html?color_scheme=redmond) (default),
[`github`](http://pamflet.databinder.net/Color+Schemes.html?color_scheme=github), and
[`monokai`](http://pamflet.databinder.net/Color+Schemes.html?color_scheme=monokai).
To set the default to `github`, define:

    color_scheme=github

#### Other UI Enhancements

- `favicon.ico` support. [#38][38]
- Hovering over a header displays "ยง", which links to the header itself. [#41][41]
- Custom css files are loaded after pretify.css.

#### Backend changes

The preview server is now using Netty, to avoid
[dependency resolution problems][orbit] with the Jetty servlet "orbit"
artifact.

#### Upgrading

Pamflet is managed through [Conscript][cs] and this version requires a
newer sbt-launcher in order to resolve its Scala 2.10.x artifacts.

    cs n8han/conscript # upgrade conscript itself
    cs --setup         # upgrade conscript's sbt-launcher
    cs n8han/pamflet   # upgrade pamflet
